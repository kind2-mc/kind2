(** Removes multiple assignment from an if block by pulling out equations
   with multiple assignment and using temp variables. 
  Example: 
   if cond
   then 
      y1, y2 = node(expr1);
   else
      y1 = expr2;
      y2 = expr3;
   fi
  -->
   t1, t2 = node(expr1);
   if cond
   then 
      y1 = t1;
      y2 = t2;
   else
      y1 = expr2;
      y2 = expr3;
   fi

  For each temp variable, we also generate a new declaration.
