(** Graph analysis on Lustre Ast Declarations.
  
    We build a dependency graph of the lustre declarations
    to detect circular dependencies and reject them. We also
    reorder node and contract declarations to resolve
    forward references as backend cannot handle them.

    Note {!Types of dependency analysis}: There are two different kinds of 
    graph dependency analysis and sorting done here. 

    1. Top level constants and type declarations (starts at [sort_globals])
       We resolve all the forward references in this step.

    2a. Nodes, functions and contracts (starts at [sort_and_check_nodes_contracts])
        We resolve all the forward references in this step.
    
    2b. Sort contract equations and perform cirularity check of node equations. 

   TODO: This should module should supercede LustreDependencies when it hardens.
