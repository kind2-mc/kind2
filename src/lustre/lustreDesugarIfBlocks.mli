 (** 
   Code for desugaring imperative-style if blocks to functional ITEs.

   Precondition: Multiple assignment has been removed from if and frame blocks.

   The code has a few steps.
    1. Parse the if block and create a map of trees, one for each variable.
    2. Fill in oracles in the trees for missing values.
    3. Remove redundancy from the trees.
    4. Convert the trees to ITE expressions.
