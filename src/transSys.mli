(** Representation of a transition system 

    A transition system is uniquely identified by its scope. A
    transition system can contain subsystems. For each subsystem there
    is a map of all state variables of the subsystem to some state
    variable in this transition system, and a function to guard term
    in the scope of the subsystem to make them valid in this
    transition system. There must be no cycles in the subsystem
    relation, that is, a transition system cannot have itself as a
    subsystem.

    A transition system constrains values of the set of state
    variables of a scope that make up the state of the transition
    system. The state variables in [state_vars] are assumed to be of
    the same scope [scope]. The initial state constraint [init] is a
    term over these state variables at offset [init_base], the
    transition relation [trans] is a term over state variables at
    offsets [trans_base] and [trans_base - 1].
