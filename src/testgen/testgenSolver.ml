(**
  Wraps a solver and provides a convenient interface for test generation.

  The goal is to be able to trigger the transition relations up to some [k].
  The wrapper thus maintains a list of actlits [a0 ; a1 ; a2 ; ... ; aN] such
  that, in the solver:
    a0 => Init(0)
    a1 => (and a0 T(0,1))
    a2 => (and a1 T(1,2))
    ...
    aN => (and aN-1 T(N-1,N))

  The client does not see this however, only the [k] at which the query should
  be made is specified. The wrapper unrolls the transition relation lazily
  whenever it is needed. See [nth_actlit_of].

  Note: [a0] is not really needed but is here for consistency.
