(*
  Reversed partial tree for depth first search. Stores the activable modes at
  k and the witnesses for each path. The tree is partial because the witnesses
  for subtrees are collapsed into a single [Witnesses] leaf. The tree is
  reversed because the entry point is the current depth, the last element is
  the root.

  The idea is that when hitting the maximal depth during the exploration of the
  tree of activable modes, a witness is generated. This witness is propagated
  upward the reverse partial tree when backtracking.
