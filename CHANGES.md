# Kind 2 v1.8.0

New features:

- Add syntax for If-Then-Else constraints and Frame Condition constraints (see [documentation](https://kind.cs.uiowa.edu/kind2_user_doc/2_input/1_lustre.html#if-statements-and-frame-conditions)).
- Add support for SMT solver Bitwuzla.
  - Its predecessor, Boolector, is no longer supported.
- Add option `--flatten_proof` to break down LFSC proofs into a sequence of lemmas.
  - This option helps reduce the memory footprint of the LFSC checker and improve its performance as the proof for each lemma is verified by the LFSC checker independently.

Improvements:

- Fixes and improvements solving machine integer problems:
  - Support for non-standard bit-vector constants and symbols returned by MathSAT and Z3
  - Fix path compression bit-vector encoding in minimization of set of invariants.
- Fixes and improvements in the new Lustre front-end.


# Kind 2 v1.7.0

New features:

- Support for new SMT solver cvc5.
  - Its predecessor, CVC4, is no longer supported.
- A revamp of Kind 2's proof production facility:
  - The new version replaces CVC4 with cvc5 as the main back-end proof-producing SMT solver.
  - It produces more detailed proofs and covers a wider range of input models.
  - The new proofs are still processable by the external proof checker LFSC.

Improvements:

- Support for unary negation and subtraction of unsigned machine integers.
- Fix invariant pruner: some non-trivial one-state invariants were not included in certificates.
- Fix problem with reported locations in IVC output.
- Fix selection of logic in computation of MCS.
- Fix version detection of SMT solvers.
- Multiple fixes and improvements in the new Lustre front-end.


# Kind 2 v1.6.0

New features:

- A new implementation of Kind 2's language front-end with:
  - Support for forward references to nodes and modes in contracts.
  - Individual namespaces for imported contracts.
  - Enhanced type checking of composite data types.

  Internally, the new implementation follows a multi-pass approach more strictly.
  This should facilitate the extensibility and maintenance of the new front-end.
  Although we strongly encourage users to use the new front-end,
  the old front-end can still be enabled for now by passing
  `--old_frontend true` to Kind 2.

Improvements:

- Fix issue where the inductive step check could incorrectly declare a property
  k-inductive after a contract has been refined in compositional verification.
- Fix bug in minimization of set of invariants.
- Fix XML and JSON output produced by the certificate generation post-analysis.
- Include various updates and fixes to the realizability and
  satisfiability checks of contracts. Now there is a flag to (de)activate
  the computation of a deadlocking trace, `--print_deadlock`, and a flag to
  (de)activate the satisfiability check of an unrealizable contract,
  `--check_contract_is_sat`.

Changes:

- New default behavior: if no node is marked as a main node,
  Kind 2 considers _all_ the top nodes for analysis.
- Functional congruence is only enforced on abstract functions when
  the flag `--enforce_func_congruence` is true (default: false).
- Make Kind 2 compatible with recent versions of Menhir (20211230 and later).
- Remove two experimental post-analyses: invariant logging and silent contract loading.
- Remove support for automata.

- Fix generation of tracing information when a contract is proven unrealizable.
- Fix shape of generated invariant candidates when `--invgen_all_out` is true.
- Fix generation of SMT-LIB 2 certificates.
- Make Kind 2 compatible with the latest version (5.1.4) of the OCaml bindings for ZMQ.

In addition, this version adds support for a new Visual Studio Code
[extension](https://github.com/kind2-mc/vscode-kind2) for Kind 2.

Thanks to Andreas Katis for his feedback and bug reports.


# Kind 2 v1.5.0

New features:

- Print a deadlocking trace and a set of conflicting constraints when a contract is proven unrealizable.
- Multiple nodes can be annotated as main nodes so that analysis results for common subnodes are shared in modular analysis.
- New option to dump each counterexample to a file (`--dump_cex`).

Improvements:

- Require and ensure clauses of contract modes are eligible elements for IVCs and MCSs when the contracts category is selected.

# Kind 2 v1.1.0

This new version features many internal improvements as well as several new
features over v1.0.1 (more than 300 commits):

- Support for Scade 6 automata (see [documentation](https://kind.cs.uiowa.edu/kind2_user_doc/2_input/1_lustre.html#hierarchical-automata))
- Support for Scade 6 arrays
- Arithmetic invariant generation: up to v1.0.1, the main invariant generation
  technique besides the IC3 engine was boolean template-based invariant
  generation. This technique can discover equalities and implications between
  predicates over the state variables of the system.

  The technique has been extended to arithmetic terms (`int` and `real`): Kind
  2 can discover equalities and orderings (`<=`) between arithmetic terms mined
  from the input system.

  The boolean, integer and real template-based invariant generation techniques
  all come in two flavors: one-state which can only relate terms over the
  current state, and two-state which can relate terms mentioning the current
  and the previous state.

  Each of them runs as a different process at runtime. By default, only the
  following are active:

  - INVGENOS (one-state boolean)
  - INVGEN (two-state boolean)
  - INVGENINTOS (one-state integer)
  - INVGENREALOS (one-state real)
- Several features distinct from the actual verification process were
  introduced in Kind 2 v1.0.0: certification, contract generation, compilation
  to Rust, and test generation.

  These features are now aggregated under the term [*post-analyses*](https://kind.cs.uiowa.edu/kind2_user_doc/9_other/1_post_analyses.html).
  Most of them have been improved and v1.1.0 introduces a post-analysis:
  [invariant logging](https://kind.cs.uiowa.edu/kind2_user_doc/9_other/7_invariant_logging.html). This feature attempts to log
  strengthening invariants discovered by Kind 2 as a contract.
- *Silent contract loading* attempts to load contracts generated by Kind 2
  during previous runs as candidate properties for the current run (see
  [documentation](https://kind.cs.uiowa.edu/kind2_user_doc/9_other/1_post_analyses.html#silent-contract-loading))


# Kind 2 v1.0.1

- Read files on standard input in Lustre format


# Kind 2 v1.0.0

This new version brings many new features and improvements over v0.8 (more
than 800 commits).

NB:

- Kind 2 now requires OCaml 4.03 or higher

New features:

- 2-induction: makes Kind 2 react quicker to *good strengthening invariants*
  discovered by invariant generation
- Assume/guarantee-based contract language with modes as Lustre annotations (see [documentation](https://kind.cs.uiowa.edu/kind2_user_doc/2_input/1_lustre.html#contracts))
    - specification-checking: before checking a node with a contract, check
      that the modes from the contract cover all situations allowed by the
      assumptions (implementation-agnostic mode exhaustiveness)
- Compositional reasoning: `--compositional` (see [contract semantics](https://kind.cs.uiowa.edu/kind2_user_doc/9_other/2_contract_semantics.html))
    - abstraction of subnodes by their contract
- Modular analyses: `--modular`
    - Kind 2 traverses the node hierarchy bottom-up
    - applying the analysis specified by the other flags to each node
    - reusing results (invariants) from previous analyses when relevant
    - allows refinement when used with compositional reasoning
- Compilation from Lustre to [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/): `--compile`
- Mode-based test generation: `--testgen`
    - explores the DAG of activeable modes from the initial state up to a depth
    - generates witnesses as traces of inputs logged as XML files
    - compiles the contract as an executable oracle in
      [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/): reads a sequence of inputs/outputs
      values for the original node on `stdin` and prints on `stdout` the
      boolean values the different parts of the contract evaluate to
- Generation of certificates and proofs: `--proof` and `--certif`
    - produces either SMTLIB-2 certificates or LFSC proofs
    - distributed with LFSC proof rules for k-induction
    - requires CVC4, JKind and the LFSC checker for proofs
    - generate proofs skeletons for potential holes
- Support for forward references on nodes, types, constants and contracts
- Output and parser for native (internal) transition system format
- Contract generation: `--contract_gen`
  - Very experimental: the modes generated might not be exhaustive and the
    check exhaustiveness check might fail
  - This feature's main goal, for now, is to help users get started with
    contracts by generating a contract stub partially filled with invariants
    discovered by invariant generation

Improvements:

- Flags are now organized into modules, see `--help` and `--help_of <module>`
- Mode information (when available) to counterexample output
- Optimized invariant generation
- Named properties and guarantees
- Colored output
- No more dependencies on Camlp4
- Strict mode to disallow unguarded pre and undefined local variables
- Many bug fixes and performance improvements
- Added mode information (when available) to counterexample output
- Rewrote invariant generation from scratch: much faster now
- czmq fixes: there should be no process still running after Kind 2 exits
