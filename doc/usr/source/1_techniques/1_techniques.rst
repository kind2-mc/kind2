Techniques
==========

This section presents the techniques available in Kind 2: how they work,
and how they can be tweaked through various options:


* :ref:`1_techniques/2_kinduction`
* :ref:`1_techniques/3_invgen`
* :ref:`1_techniques/4_ic3`

Compositional reasoning
-----------------------

When verifying a node ``n``\ , *compositional reasoning* consists in abstracting
the complexity of the subnodes of ``n`` by their contracts (see :ref:`9_other/2_contract_semantics`).
The idea is that the contract has typically a lot less state than the node it specifies,
which in addition to its own state contains that of its subnodes recursively.

Compositional reasoning thus improves the scalability of Kind 2 by taking
advantage of information provided by the user to abstract the complexity away.
When in compositional mode (\ ``--composition true``\ ), Kind 2 will abstract all
calls (to subnodes that have a contract with at least one guarantee or one mode)
in the top node and verify the resulting, abstract system.

A successful compositional proof of a node does not guarantee the correctness
of the concrete (un-abstracted) node though, since the subnodes have not been
verified. For this reason compositional reasoning is usually applied in
conjunction with *modular reasoning*\ , discussed in the next section.

Modular reasoning
-----------------

*Modular reasoning* is activated with the option ``--modular true``. In this
mode, Kind 2 will perform whatever type of analysis is specified by the other
flags on **every node** of the hierarchy, bottom-up. The analysis is
completed on every node even if some node is proved unsafe because of
the falsification of one of its properties.

A timeout for *each analysis* can be specified using the ``--timeout_analysis``
flag. It can be used in conjunction with the *global timeout* given with the
``--timeout`` or ``--timeout_wall`` time.

Internally Kind 2 builds on previous analyses when starting a new one. For
instance, by using the invariants previously discovered in subnodes of the node
under analysis.

Refinement in compositional and modular analyses
------------------------------------------------

An interesting configuration is

.. code-block:: none

   kind2 --modular true --compositional true ...

If ``top`` calls ``sub`` and we analyze ``top``\ , it means we have previously analyzed
``sub``. We are running in compositional mode so the call to ``sub`` is originally
abstracted by its contract.
Say the analysis fails with a counterexample. The counterexample might be
spurious for the concrete version of ``sub``\ : the failure would not happen if we
used the concrete call to ``sub`` instead of the abstract one.

Say now that when we analyzed ``sub``\ , we proved that it is correct. In this case
Kind 2 will attempt to *refine* the call to ``sub`` in top. That is, undo the
abstraction and use the implementation of ``sub`` in a new analysis.

Note that since ``sub`` is known to be correct, it is stronger than its contract.
More precisely, it accepts fewer execution traces than its contract does. Hence
anything proved with the abstraction of ``sub`` is still valid after refinement,
and Kind 2 will use these results right away.

Modifiers to control node/function abstraction
----------------------------------------------

To prevent Kind 2 from *abstracting* a specific node or function that has both a body
and a contract during compositional analysis,
use the ``transparent`` modifier before the ``node`` or ``function`` keywords:

.. code-block::

   transparent function F(...) returns (...)

To prevent Kind 2 from *refining* a specific node or function that has both a body
and a contract during compositional and modular analyses,
use the ``opaque`` modifier before the ``node`` or ``function`` keywords:

.. code-block::

   opaque node N(...) returns (...)
